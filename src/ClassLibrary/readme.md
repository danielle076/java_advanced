## Class library of Java

Java's application interface (API) consists of a large collection of software components that provide programming tools

Examples:
- graphical user interface (GUI)
    - javax (for Swing)
- java.util
- java.lang.Math
- java.io

More and more you will start using external classes. These will reside in an external library/library that you need to load via a .jar file (or better via Maven).

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is related to the access modifiers private, public, protected.

With encapsulation, the variables of a class are hidden from other classes and are accessible only through the methods of their current class.

Therefore, it is also called <i>data hiding</i>.

To achieve encapsulation in Java:
- Declare the variables (properties) of a class as private.
- Develop public get&set methods to modify and view the variable values.

### Encapsulation1

_Player.java_ <br/>
step 1: creating variables <br/>
step 2: not using a constructor <br/>
step 3: method loseHealth <br/>
step 4: method healthRemaining

_Main.java_ <br/>
step 5: create an instance

### Encapsulation2

_EnhancedPlayer.java_ <br/>
step 6: creating variables <br/>
step 7: creating a constructor <br/>
step 8: method loseHealth <br/>
step 9: getter

_Main.java_ <br/>
step 10: create an instance
